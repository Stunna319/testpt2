    <p>String of Fishhooks 6 Inch Unpotted
        
        The String of Fishhooks is an easy-to-care-for and robust succulent. It sits beautifully on a shelf because of its trailing vines. The String of Fish Hooks is very similar to the String of Bananas and can sometimes be mixed up. The String of Fish Hooks is blueish green in color and the leaves are much thinner and hook-like. This plant comes in its 6" hanging plastic nursery pot. 
        
        Light: Bright light. Keep it away from direct exposure to the hot sun.
        
        Water: Allow soil to dry completely between waterings
