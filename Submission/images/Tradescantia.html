    <p>Tradescantia Nanouk 2 Inch In Ceramic Pot
        
        This beautiful green, pink, and white striped plant is easy to care for and also easy to propagate! This cross-pollinated variety originated from the Netherlands. We are selling them in this petite size, but they are fast growers. The more light it gets, the more vibrant the color will be, so give this plant some good light. Some temporary direct sun is great! The plant you receive may be in either ceramic pot design, but you may request one in checkout notes and we will do our best to accommodate.
        
        Light: Bright, indirect sunlight or full sun
        
        
        Water: Water when the top inch of the soil is dry. Be careful not to overwater.
